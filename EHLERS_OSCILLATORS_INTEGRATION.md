### 5. **MESA Adaptive Moving Average (MAMA)**
- **Purpose**: Adapts to the current cycle period for optimal trend following
- **Best for**: Dynamic trend analysis that adjusts to market conditions
- **Y-axis**: Price-based (matches commodity price scale)
- **Reference**: "MESA and Trading Market Cycles" - Chapter 6

### 6. **Sinewave Indicator**
- **Purpose**: Identifies when the market is in cycle mode vs. trend mode
- **Best for**: Market regime identification and timing
- **Y-axis Range**: -1 to +1 with zero line reference
- **Reference**: "Rocket Science for Traders" - Chapter 8

### 7. **Hilbert Transform Discriminator**
- **Purpose**: Measures instantaneous phase for precise cycle analysis
- **Best for**: Advanced cycle timing and phase analysis
- **Y-axis Range**: -1 to +1 with zero line reference
