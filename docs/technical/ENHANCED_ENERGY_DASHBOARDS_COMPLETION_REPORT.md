## üîß Technical Improvements

### 1. Hybrid API Implementation
```python
# Intelligent API routing logic
if data_type in ['generation', 'renewable_share', 'load']:
    # Prefer Energy Charts for generation data
    try_energy_charts_first()
else:
    # Prefer ENTSO-E for price data
    try_entsoe_first()
```

### 2. Enhanced Chart Functions
- `createPriceChart()` - Professional price visualizations
- `createGenerationMixChart()` - Stacked area charts for generation mix
- `createRenewableShareChart()` - Filled line charts for renewable percentage
- `createLoadChart()` - Load demand visualizations
- `createAnalyticsDashboard()` - Multi-chart analytics view
- `createRenewablesDashboard()` - Renewable-focused analysis

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Specific Exception Types:** Replaced broad Exception catches
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Clear feedback for different error conditions
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Automatic API switching when one source fails
- **Loading State Management:** Proper loading/error state transitions

## üìä Performance Metrics
